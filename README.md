# TNDifference
This is an extension for Fantasy Grounds VTT written in Lua.

## What does it do

Highlight rolls that differ from the target by the amount set up by the user.

This extension allows to set up thresholds for attacks, saves and skill checks. When a roll exceeds or falls under the TN by this or greater amount, an icon and a message will be displayed in chat.

Please check the settings after you activate the extension, you will find all the dials, which rolls to highligt and what thresholds you want there.
