# TNDifference
This is an extension for Fantasy Grounds VTT written in Lua.

## What it does

Highlight rolls that differ from the target by the amount set up by the user.

This extension allows to set up thresholds for attacks, saves and skill checks. When a roll exceeds or falls under the TN by this or greater amount, an icon and a message will be displayed in chat.
